faire attention au count(*)


collision_in_weather, what is the primary key ? or do we need one ?


what do you mean by the feedback on query 7 deliverable 2 ? It looks because of our star schema we need to do that.


is query 8 of deliverable 2 too nested ? it would be so much more simple to have 2 queries.



what is the best option for the query 4 in deliverable 3 ?




What do you think are the best queries to optimize considering our star schema ?


is query 5 too nested ?


how the fuck do you query 6 ? it's hard bruh


are count(*) in query 8 correct ?
